  * Type-Tiny
      * new type constraints for Types::Standard
          * Tied - i.e. references to tied variables. Parameterized:
            Tied["Some::Package"]
          * steal from MooseX-Types-Ro?
      * coercion
          * Auto-coercion
              * needs documenting
      * improve speed for non-inlineable type constraints and coercions
          * maybe use eval context idea from Type::Check
      * Type-Tiny could be used as a backend for Scalar::Does?
          * if not, certainly a SEE ALSO
      * moar tests
          * Exporter::TypeTiny
      * Types-XSD
