- sanity check type names
- subclasses of Type::Tiny, along same lines as Type::Tiny::Class
	- role_type
	- duck_type
	- enum
	- union
	- intersection
- documentation
- expand standard type library of types:
	- MooseX::Types::Structured
- Mouse compat?
- implement has_coercion_for_type; this means I need to be able to figure out when $type1 >= $type2
- create "plus_coercions" and "minus_coercions" methods for Type::Tiny which create a new anonymous subtypewith additional/fewer coercions
