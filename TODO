- get test suite passing again re stdlibs
- sanity check type names
- class_type, role_type, duck_type, enum, union, intersection
- documentation
- expand standard type library of types:
	- MooseX::Types::Structured
- Mouse compat?
- implement has_coercion_for_type; this means I need to be able to figure out when $type1 >= $type2
- create "plus_coercions" and "minus_coercions" methods for Type::Tiny which create a new anonymous subtypewith additional/fewer coercions
